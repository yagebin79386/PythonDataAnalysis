# Use Purpose
This project is more intended for education purpose. It contains the exercises around the topic data analysis using python numby and pandas. Each exercise can be better imported using jupyter notebook to allow seperated code execution. The user can directly try with own solution under the problem explaination.
To avail the learner to get familiar with basic python operation, the first exercise start with the sample arithmatic operations. Then it gradually imigrates more advanced methods and embedded functions from Python. This part exercise can be found in Python_basic.py[Python_basic.py]
The second exercise Exercise_numpy_pandas.py[Exercise_numpy_pandas.py] helps the learner to learn how to create objects heritaged from numby and pandas like array, series and dataframe. And it brings in the skills of operation and manipulation of those objects too.
